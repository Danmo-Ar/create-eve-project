# Create Eve Project : Node Cli Tool

This CLI tool should help us start new projects faster, with prebuilt and preconfigured architecture bundled with some extra reusable components (UI components, helper functions, etc.).

_Deploy on npm sooner_

   Open your terminal and execute the following command:

   ```bash
   # Start in watch mode

   npm build
   ```

2. **Run `create-eve-project` Command:**
   Open your terminal and execute the following command:

   ```bash
   create-eve-project
   ```
