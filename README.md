# Eve CLI : Node Cli Tool

This CLI tool should help us start new projects faster, with prebuilt and preconfigured architecture bundled with some extra reusable components (UI components, helper functions, etc.).

## Installation guide

### Install the CLI tool globally

```bash
npm i @eve-tools/cli
```

### Verify the installation

```bash

```

this command directly output the cli help to have glimpse of commands and options.

### Initialize the project by following the prompt

>

```bash
eve init
```

or

```bash
    npx @eve-tools/cli init
```

prompt will ask for project name, language, and framework to use.
we actually work on shortcut with option to skip prompt and directly initialize project with default values.
