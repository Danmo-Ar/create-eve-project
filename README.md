# Create Eve Project : Node Cli Tool

This CLI tool should help us start new projects faster, with prebuilt and preconfigured architecture bundled with some extra reusable components (UI components, helper functions, etc.).

> ### Features of Our Node.js CLI Tool : In Progress
>
> - **Start Project**: Initialize a new project based on boilerplate templates (Frontend, Backend) depending on the chosen language and framework.
> - **Init Function**: Generate a JSON configuration file and install packages if the user opts in.
> - **Add Command**: Based on the generated JSON configuration, add UI components, workflows, or reusable functions to the current project.
> - **Big Components UI**: Predefined UI components for frontend development to speed up the project process.
> - _We'll add more feature as we going_
